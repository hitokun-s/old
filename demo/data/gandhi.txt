I believe that in the history of the world, there has not been a more genuinely democratic struggle for freedom than ours. 
I read Carlyleâ€™s French Resolution while I was in prison, and Pandit Jawaharlal has told me something about the Russian revolution. 
But it is my conviction that inasmuch as these struggles were fought with the weapon of violence they failed to realize the democratic ideal. 
In the democracy which I have envisaged, a democracy established by non-violence, there will be equal freedom for all. 
Everybody will be his own master. 
It is to join a struggle for such democracy that I invite you today. 
Once you realize this you will forget the differences between the Hindus and Muslims, and think of yourselves as Indians only, engaged in the common struggle for independence.
